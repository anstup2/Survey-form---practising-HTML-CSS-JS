# Survey-form---practising-HTML-CSS-JS

This first project https://codepen.io/anstup2/pen/XWeGoOY is for practising my HTML , CSS, and JS skills in freecodecamp.
The form is supposed to create a Survey form , which when clicking on the Submit - in case the required fields (Name, Email and Age) are not filled in, it redirects you to them .
If the required fields are filled in, the by submitting the survey we get a "Thank you for submitting this survey" pop up message.
